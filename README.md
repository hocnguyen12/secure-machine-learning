# Second Year Project at ENSICAEN engineering school

Students : **Cecile LU, Paul NGUYEN, Zeyd BOUMAHDI, Anis AHMEDZAID, Noura OUTLIOUA**

Our project involves performing prediction tasks on encrypted data. To achieve this, we aim to train our models to recognize numerical images. For further details please refer to the documents in the /doc directory.

## Models

The details on the models can be found inside the doc in "Rapport_Apprentissage_Securise"

- **EncCNN**: This model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is designed to operate on encrypted data.
- **EncFCNN**: This model is a variant of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) adapted for encrypted data.
- **FHE**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic technique that enables computations on encrypted data without decryption.
